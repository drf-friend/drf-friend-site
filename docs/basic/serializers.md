## ModelSerializer

```python title="moduels/{module_name}/serializers.py"
from .models import User
from drf_friend.drf_core import ModelSerializer
from drf_friend.drf_core import serializers

class UserSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    # assign field and type casting
    id = serializers.CharField()

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = '__all__'
```

### specific fields
You can specify specific fields in the `Meta class` to include only the desired fields in the serialized representation:

```python
class Meta:
  fields = ['field_1', 'field2']
```

### modify field data

To modify the representation of a field, you can override the to_representation method in your serializer:

```python
class UserSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    # assign field and type casting
    id = serializers.CharField()

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = '__all__'

    def to_representation(self, instance):
        # Modify the representation of the object
        representation = super().to_representation(instance)
        representation['name'] = f"Modified: {instance.name}"
        return representation
```

### exclude fields

You can exclude specific fields from the serialized representation using the exclude_fields helper function from `drf_friend.raw_query.helpers`:

```python
from drf_friend.raw_query.helpers import exclude_fields

def to_representation(self, instance):
    # Modify the representation of the object
    representation = super().to_representation(instance)
    representation['name'] = f"Modified: {instance.name}"
    representation = exclude_fields(representation, [ 'password'])
    return representation
```

### fields

```python
from drf_friend.drf_core import serializers

# serializers.{fieldType}
name = serializers.CharField()
```
